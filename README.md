# MLB-Hall-of-Fame-Predictor

The objective of this project was to assess the extent to which various machine learning methods, including logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis and decision trees, were able to predict whether a newly-eligible player would be inducted into the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame.

In this repository, you can find an annotated markdown file with all the code and output, as well as a slide deck for the in-class presentation.
